# Hisense AC (AEH-W4A1) - Domoticz Python plugin
**Domoticz Python plugin for Hisense AC (AEH-W4A1)**

## Information
 - *This plugin is based the [Library for Hisense AEH-W4A1](https://github.com/bannhead/pyaehw4a1) by Davide Varricchio. Thank you very much for your work.*
 - *Python I see for the third time in my life, I write on it for the first time. If there is a person who will bring the ugliness that I wrote to a normal form I will be very grateful.*
 - *Written this under beer and heavy metal. So, it comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. :)*
